					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						I've created a Python script that scrapes playlist data from a few of the popular Cape Breton radio stations and ran it every
						four hours starting from December 16th, 2016 up to January 1st, 2017 at 12:00 AM (Atlantic Standard Time/UTC-0400). I was curious
						about how many times certain songs were played, especially during the Christmas season. It would've been nicer to get a full month's
						worth of data, but unfortunately I never thought of the idea until close to the middle of the month. All in all, it was a fun experience
						and an excuse to teach myself the Python programming language. I've published the source code and the database 
						<a href="https://github.com/andydeveaux/CBRPS">here</a> for	anyone who wants to take a peek at it or modify it for their own use. 
						However, I warn you that the source code isn't all that pretty since I was learning as I went along and was mostly doing it as a personal 
						project. Anyway, I've built this page for you to see some of the statistics I thought were interesting and for you to be able to perform 
						your own searches on the data. Enjoy!
					</p>

						NOTE: Any misspelled or truncated song and artist names are not of my doing. The data was taken exactly as they appeared on the source pages.
